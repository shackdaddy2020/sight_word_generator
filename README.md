# sight_word_generator

The Sight Word Generator is a lean, distraction-free application built in Python with Tkinter to deliver high-frequency “sight words” in a full-screen flash-card format. Upon launch, the program loads a single CSV file that tracks each child’s mastery counts, displays one word at a time in a large, clear font, and offers checkboxes for each learner—Alexander, Rowan, Luka, and Isaac—to indicate who recognized the word. When the “Mastered” button is pressed, the app increments the selected child’s count for that word, plays a cheerful congratulatory sound, and automatically advances to the next word. If all children have met the mastery threshold (three correct recognitions), that word is excluded from further practice. Progress is saved immediately back to the CSV, ensuring that every session—even across devices or over weeks—resumes exactly where it left off.

Under the hood, the generator maintains an in-memory dictionary mapping each sight word to that word’s individual counts for each child. To choose a practice item, it filters for any word where at least one child’s count remains below the mastery threshold, then selects randomly among those candidates. This guarantees that learners spend time only on words they have not yet fully internalized, while the randomization helps maintain engagement and prevents rote ordering. By consolidating all data in a single CSV, families can easily inspect overall progress—total words mastered per child, words still in rotation, and historical mastery patterns—without juggling multiple files or complicated databases.

The educational rationale for focusing on sight words is well supported by reading science. High-frequency words—such as “the,” “to,” and “and”—comprise roughly half of the words in any text when the 100 most common words are included, and expand to about three-quarters of the text when the top 300 are learned . Automatic recognition of these words frees cognitive resources for decoding unfamiliar vocabulary and comprehending meaning, a benefit clearly articulated in the literature on orthographic mapping and fluent reading . Furthermore, the National Reading Panel’s meta-analysis found that systematic phonics instruction—which underpins sight-word mastery—yields substantial gains in decoding accuracy (effect size d = 0.67) and even boosts comprehension for young readers (d = 0.51) . By providing an exact, per-child record of sight-word mastery, this application offers parents and educators a precise, data-driven way to accelerate early literacy—far beyond what broad-stroke commercial apps can deliver.
